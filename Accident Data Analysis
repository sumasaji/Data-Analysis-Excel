# Accident Data Analysis and Data Cleaning

This repository contains an analysis and data cleaning of accident data. The dataset includes various attributes such as date, time, location, weather conditions, and details about the accidents.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and clean accident data to provide insights into patterns and trends. This can help in understanding the factors contributing to accidents and in improving safety measures.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- Date
- Month
- Year
- Day of the week
- Junction control
- Junction detail
- Accident severity
- Latitude
- Light conditions
- Local authority
- Accident location
- Longitude
- Police force
- Road surface conditions
- Road type
- Speed limit
- Time
- Urban or rural area
- Weather conditions
- Vehicle type

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved the following steps:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Identifying and filling or removing missing values in the dataset.
2. **Correcting Data Types:** Ensuring all columns have the correct data type.
3. **Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and removing duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.
4. **Standardizing Data:** Converting data into a consistent format for easy analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis focused on:
- **Accident Severity:** Analyzing the severity of accidents across different conditions.
- **Time and Date Analysis:** Examining the distribution of accidents over time.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping accident locations to identify high-risk areas.
- **Weather Conditions:** Studying the impact of weather conditions on accidents.

## Results

### Accident Severity
- Most accidents were of slight severity, with a few fatal accidents.
- Fatal accidents were more likely to occur on weekends and under poor lighting conditions.

### Time and Date Analysis
- A higher number of accidents occurred during the day, particularly during peak hours.
- January had the highest number of recorded accidents.

### Geospatial Analysis
- North Larkshire and Cumbria had the highest concentration of accidents.

### Weather Conditions
- Majority of accidents occurred under fine weather conditions with no high winds.
- Wet or icy road conditions contributed to a smaller percentage of accidents.
